# Interpretable Explanations of Black Boxes by Meaningful Perturbation
## Presentation given to Drexel XAI seminar 11/18/2021

The presentation draws on the work proposed on a 2017 paper [Interpretable Explanations of Black Boxes by Meaningful Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03296.pdf) by [Ruth Fong](https://ruthcfong.github.io/) & [Andrea Vidaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/).
